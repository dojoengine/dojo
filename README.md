**Dojo is a community driven open-source, Provable Game Engine, providing a comprehensive toolkit for building verifiable games and autonomous worlds.**

Dojo is still in its early stages of development, yet the dedicated contributors are propelling its progress at an impressive pace. The overarching aspiration for Dojo is to empower game developers to kick-start their projects, aiming to reduce the initial setup time from days to mere hours. Join the movement!

### Entity Component System

Dojo implements the ECS pattern to enable modular and extensible Autonomous Worlds. Worlds can be permissionlessly expanded over time through the incorporation of components and systems.

#### World

The `world` is the top-level concept in a Autonomous World, serving as a centralized registry, namespace, and event bus for all entities, components, systems, and resources.

#### Components

Components form the schema of the world, holding state for systems to operate on. Components struct, for example, the following implements a `Position` component which exposes a `is_zero` and `is_equal` method. The Dojo toolchain compiles components to contracts which can be declared and installed into a world.

##### Components Example

```rust
#[derive(Component, Copy, Drop, Serde)]
struct Position {
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

trait PositionTrait {
    fn is_equal(self: Position, b: Position) -> bool;
}

impl PositionImpl of PositionTrait {
    fn is_equal(self: Position, b: Position) -> bool {
        self.x == b.x & self.y == b.y
    }
}
```

#### Systems

Systems are functions operating on the world state. They receive some input from the user, retrieve state from the world, compute a state transition and apply it. A system has a single entrypoint, the `execute` function. Systems can leverage `commands` to easily interact with the world.

##### Commands

```rust
// Retrieve a unique id from the world, useful for create a new entity.
fn commands::uuid() -> felt252;

// Update an existing entity with the provided components.
fn commands::set_entity(query: Query, components: T);

// Retrieve a components for an entity.
fn commands::<T>::entity(query: Query) -> T;

// Retrieve all entity ids that match the component selector criteria.
fn commands::<T>::entities() -> Array<felt252>;
```

##### System Example

```rust
#[system]
mod SpawnSystem {
    fn execute(name: String) {
        let player_id = commands::create((
            Health::new(100_u8),
            Name::new(name)
        ));
        return ();
    }
}

#[system]
mod MoveSystem {
    fn execute(player_id: usize) {
        let player = commands<(Health, Name)>::entity(player_id);
        let positions = commands<(Position, Health)>::entities();

        // @NOTE: Loops are not available in Cairo 1.0 yet.
        for (position, health) in positions {
            let is_zero = position.is_zero();
        }
        return ();
    }
}
```

#### Entities

An entity is addressed by a `felt250`. An entity represents a collection of component state.
