**Dojo is a community driven open-source, Provable Game Engine, providing a comprehensive toolkit for building verifiable games and autonomous worlds.**

Some of Dojo features:

- Cairo 1.0 Entity Component System (ECS)
- Sozu migration planner
- [Torii](/crates/torii/README.md) networking & indexing stack
- [Katana](/crates/katana/README.md) RPC development network
- Typed SDKs for Client


## Installation

See the [installation guide](https://book.dojoengine.org/getting-started/installation.html) in the book.

## Built with Dojo 
- [Roll Your Own](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/rollyourown)
- [Realms Autonomous World](https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/eternum)

## Overview

### Entity Component System

Dojo implements the ECS pattern to enable modular and extensible Autonomous Worlds. Worlds can be permissionlessly expanded over time through the incorporation of components and systems.

#### World

The `world` is the top-level concept in a Autonomous World, serving as a centralized registry, namespace, and event bus for all entities, components, systems, and resources.

#### Components

Components form the schema of the world, holding state for systems to operate on. Components struct, for example, the following implements a `Position` component which exposes a `is_zero` and `is_equal` method. The Dojo toolchain compiles components to contracts which can be declared and installed into a world.

##### Components Example

```rust
#[derive(Component, Copy, Drop, Serde)]
struct Position {
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

trait PositionTrait {
    fn is_equal(self: Position, b: Position) -> bool;
}

impl PositionImpl of PositionTrait {
    fn is_equal(self: Position, b: Position) -> bool {
        self.x == b.x & self.y == b.y
    }
}
```

#### Systems

Systems are functions operating on the world state. They receive some input from the user, retrieve state from the world, compute a state transition and apply it. A system has a single entrypoint, the `execute` function. Systems can leverage `commands` to easily interact with the world.

##### Commands

```rust
// Retrieve a unique id from the world, useful for create a new entity.
fn commands::uuid() -> felt252;

// Update an existing entity with the provided components.
fn commands::set_entity(query: Query, components: T);

// Retrieve a components for an entity.
fn commands::<T>::entity(query: Query) -> T;

// Retrieve all entity ids that match the component selector criteria.
fn commands::<T>::entities() -> Array<felt252>;
```

##### System Example

```rust
#[system]
mod SpawnSystem {
    fn execute(name: String) {
        let player_id = commands::create((
            Health::new(100_u8),
            Name::new(name)
        ));
        return ();
    }
}

#[system]
mod MoveSystem {
    fn execute(player_id: usize) {
        let player = commands<(Health, Name)>::entity(player_id);
        let positions = commands<(Position, Health)>::entities();

        // @NOTE: Loops are not available in Cairo 1.0 yet.
        for (position, health) in positions {
            let is_zero = position.is_zero();
        }
        return ();
    }
}
```

#### Entities

An entity is addressed by a `felt250`. An entity represents a collection of component state.
