# Dojo release dispatch workflow.
#
# This workflow is used to manually trigger a release.
#
# The workflow will propose a release with the same version as the one passed as input to the workflow, taking care of updating Cargo.toml versions.
#
# The workflow will create a PR, which must be manually merged to trigger the release.
# If the release triggered by the merged of this PR fails, the `release.yml` workflow can be used to be triggered again on main.
