# fetch-mock

Mock http requests made using [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch).

Features include:

- mocks most of the fetch API spec, even advanced behaviours such as streaming and aborting
- declarative matching for most aspects of a http request, including url, headers, body and query parameters
- shorthands for the most commonly used features, such as matching a http method or matching one fetch only
- support for delaying responses, or using your own async functions to define custom race conditions
- can be used as a spy to observe real network requests
- can be extended with your own reusable custom matchers that can be used both for matching fetch-calls and inspecting the results
- isomorphic, and supports either a global fetch instance or a locally required instance

_New_ If using jest, try the new [fetch-mock-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-mock-jest) wrapper.

## Documentation and Usage

See the [project website](http://www.wheresrhys.co.uk/fetch-mock/) or [cheatsheet](https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/blob/master/docs/cheatsheet.md)
